		<p> In the beginning of the reading, Seu asks readers to “defamiliarize our tools”. By saying that, I think she wants the readers to think outside the box. We have various interactions with the tools in our daily lives but we are just too familiar with the purpose of the tool and use it the same way. Sometimes, we forget the how the tools interact with our daily lives and lose the importance of it. However, by defamiliarizing our tools, the readers will be able to gain deeper understanding of the tools and to learn new aspects of the area that was not familiar with. Furthermore, the connection between poetry and defamiliarizing the tools have significant relations. Poetry and the digital tools can be both interpreted as a language behind the art that communicates the information or deeper meanings with the audiences.</p>
 

		<p> In my definition of “performing data”, it is a poetic tool that takes gathered data into a visual representation to make better connections with people. By visualizing the data into different aesthetic forms, it allows the communication to be more effective and engaging to the people. https://www.livescience.com/43905-science-data-as-art-spectacles.html,  (Links to an external site.)
